# B3DExport
.py - a blender 2.80 .b3d export script - for Minetest.

License: gpl-2.0

This version is maintained for compatibility with the minetest game engine
specifically, and is not kept up to date with more recent versions - these
are known to break the models' orientation and are thus not usable.

### [Best Practices]
(https://docs.blender.org/api/current/info_best_practice.html)
- PEP8
- "camel caps" [sic] for class names (a.k.a. PascalCase)
- [x] all lower case underscore separated module names: my_module
- [x] indentation of 4 spaces (no tabs)
- spaces around operators
- only use explicit imports, (no importing *)
